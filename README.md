# Business Intelligence â€“ F25
Welcome to Group 12's Git repository for the Business Intelligence course (F25). This repo contains all our mini-projects for the course.

## Mini Project 1: Data Ingestion and Wrangling
This project was part of the Data Ingestion and Wrangling assignment. Our goal was to collect, load, clean, visualize, and store data from multiple file formats.

### Overview
We worked with data in the following formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- TXT

We created Python functions to:

- Load data into pandas DataFrames
- Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values)
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Note
We initially misunderstood the task and used our own datasets located in the /data folder. However, we later created a small project called "World of Harry Potter" where we fetched data from an API.
