#  Mini Project 2 – Skill Building Through Collaboration  
**Business Intelligence – F25**  
_Group 12 Repository_

---

##  Objectives

This project supports both Business Intelligence learning goals and the development of collaborative programming skills.

### Key Goals:
- **Collaborative Learning:** Work together to tackle a new and abstract subject area, often in an unfamiliar teaching language.
- **Communication:** Encourage constructive dialogue within the group and with instructors to solve challenges more effectively.
- **AI Collaboration:** Learn to work alongside AI tools (such as the AI Moderator) as assistants—not as code generators.

This is the first time this format is used in programming at Cphbusiness, and we aim for a productive, fun, and educational experience.

##  AI Moderator

A specially designed virtual chatbot, the **AI Moderator**, will assist your team throughout the project.

### What the AI Moderator Can Do:
- **Guide the workflow:** Suggest task order, prompt discussion, and encourage equal contribution.
- **Help structure your process:** Offer planning advice, but will not write code for you.
- **Provide feedback:** Check code for errors or issues when asked—but won’t generate full solutions.
- **Log the discussion:** Summarize or save your session, which can be sent to your email for reference.

##  Recommended Practices

- All group members should contribute actively to the project.
- Rotate roles: one student collects all modules, ensures the final version is on GitHub, and submits it on Moodle. A different member should do this for the next project.
- Prioritize human-to-human collaboration. If the AI Moderator becomes too intrusive, feel free to minimize its role.
- Everyone is encouraged to interact with the Moderator. It can be addressed in writing or via microphone.
- Instructors (Dora and Chris) are available throughout the process for help and dialogue.
- Use the communication tools asynchronously when needed—your teammates can respond later.

##  Suggested Workflow

1. **Read the task** individually to understand the requirements.
2. **Plan together:** As a group, design a work schedule that spans until the deadline. Some parts of the task may be introduced later.
3. **Brainstorm and analyze:** Discuss how to solve the problem using data wrangling, exploration, and visualization. Decide whether to use Jupyter notebooks, Python packages, or both.
4. **Split tasks:** Break down the implementation and assign subtasks to group members or pairs. Plan for code validation and testing. Use the Moderator for testing if needed.
5. **Develop individually:** Begin working on your assigned parts. Refer to class exercises, the Titanic demo, instructors, the Moderator, and trusted sources. Avoid copy-pasting large code blocks—write and test smaller pieces yourself.
6. **Integrate as a group:** During the next workshop, merge everyone’s work into a final, clean solution. Organize your files clearly.  
   - Write a short `README.md` summarizing your process and results.
   - List group member names and their contributions.
   - Reflect on your experience with the AI Moderator.
