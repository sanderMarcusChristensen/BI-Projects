# MINI PROJECT 1: DATA INGESTION AND WRANGLING

## Glossary

**Data Ingestion** is the process of obtaining, importing, and processing data for later use or storage in a database. This can be achieved manually, or automatically using a combination of software and hardware tools designed specifically for this task. — *IBM*

**Data Wrangling**, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. — *Wikipedia*

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to enable you to build and train your skills in data collection, exploration and preprocessing.

## Tasks

Data comes from various origins in different formats, such as:

Before being analysed, it needs to be extracted, loaded, and transformed (ETL) into appropriate Python data structures, such as `pandas` DataFrame or `numpy` numeric array.

Your tasks are:

1. Choose minimum three source data formats, including both structured and unstructured data. Use the icons displayed above as a hint, but feel free to extend the list of known file formats if you have any other in mind.  

2. Write Python functions for loading data from each of the selected types of sources and transforming it into a Python data structure.  

3. Ingest the data by use of your functions.  

4. Explore and clean the ingested data as needed.  

5. Apply anonymisation if necessary.  

6. Apply visualisation techniques, as many as appropriate.  

7. Store the code and the visuals with some brief explanation text in one GitHub repository, which you will be using for the rest of the course.  

8. Upload a link to the repository in the Moodle’s flow by **12/04/2025, 23:59**.

## Notes

- It is a teamwork task.  
- The completed solution brings **20 SP (study points)** to every participating team member.  
- The original solutions (data loading functions) will be collected in the class repository and made available for shared use.
