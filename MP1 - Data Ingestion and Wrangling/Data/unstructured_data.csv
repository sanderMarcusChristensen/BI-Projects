Ugh. This product took forever to arrive... and then it was the wrong color. So annoyed.
"Loved it! Great fit, fast delivery. Definitely ordering again :)"
The packaging was damaged when it arrived. I had to return it. Support was helpful tho.
why does the website keep crashing every time I try to pay? Fix it please.
Ordered two weeks ago and still no update. What's going on?
Amazing quality and customer service. Even better than I expected!
Meh. It's okay. Just not as good as the photos made it look.
Live chat support said they’d escalate my issue but nothing’s happened.
My parcel was left outside in the rain. Everything inside got soaked.
I’ve bought this three times now. You guys rock. Never disappoint.
